### What I learned

My initial thoughts at the beginning of this project: Be thankful for each and every client who trusts you with their dreams.  Seeing a project as your bread and butter is a warped view.  It is an oppertuninty to reflect your valiews and help people achieving what they set out to do. Play your part and everything else will fall into place.
